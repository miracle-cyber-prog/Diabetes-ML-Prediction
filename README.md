# Diabetes-ML-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict diabetes using python, pandas, and scikit-learn.
# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes. It includes data cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and basic visualization.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Format: CSV
- Size: ~767 samples, 8 features

## 📊 Workflow
1. Load and explore data
2. Clean missing/zero values
3. Visualize feature distributions
4. Train/Test Split
5. Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
6. Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning
- data separation
- data spliting
- finding accuracy
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Testing
- Evaluation Metrics
- Visualization

## 📈 Results
- Best Accuracy: **80% (Logistic Regression)**
